# Creating Networks in Edgy

## About

[Edgy](http://www.snap-apps.org/edgy.html){:target="_blank"} is a modification of the *Snap!* language that allows you to use code blocks to create *Networks* and visualise *Graph* algorithms.

You will learn about the following *Networks* concepts in this activity:

- *Graphs and Subgraphs*
- *Complete Simple Graphs*
- *Random Graphs*
- *Cyclic Graphs*
- *Connected Graphs*

This activity will also involve applying some of the concepts that you learned about in the [Coding in Snap! Activity]({{ site.baseurl | append: site.coding_path }}), including:

- *Sequencing*
- *Repetition*
- *Variables*
- *Functions*
- *Branching*
- *Lists*

You will also learn about *Stacks* and *Dictionaries*, which are data structures that are similar to *Lists*.

## Activity Solutions

The solutions to the *Check Your Understanding* exercises from the activity are [available here](solutions).

## Extra Activities

If you complete the activity early in the session or are interested in finding out more about Edgy after the workshop, there is also a "gentle introduction" to Edgy with instructional videos and tutorials available from the [Programming with Edgy](https://www.alexandriarepository.org/syllabus/programming-with-edgy/){:target="_blank"} website.

## Data Sets for Networks Problems

We have included some links to some websites where you can view and download a variety of different data sets that contain *Networks*.
Examples of the data sets that can be downloaded include *Social Networks* of animals and *Transportation Networks*.
Note that the files downloaded may not be in the *DOT* file format and consequently they may not be able to be directly imported into *Edgy*.
