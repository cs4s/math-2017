# Finding MSTs in Edgy

## About

In this session, you will learn how to find *Mininum Spanning Trees* in *Graphs* using these algorithms:

- *Kruskal's*
- *Prim's*

This activity will involve combining all of the *Networks* and *Coding* concepts that you have learned about in the workshop's activities.
You will also learn how to sort *edges* in a *Graph* and about *Priority Queues*, which are a *Collection* that are similar to *Lists* and *Stacks*.

*Minimum Spanning Trees* are mentioned in the [MS-N1 Networks and Paths Course Content for the Mathematics Standard Year 12 Syllabus](http://syllabus.nesa.nsw.edu.au/mathematics-standard-stage6/content/1280/){:target="_blank"}.
The Course Content section *N1.2: Shortest paths* mentions that students should be able to:

- determine the *Minimum Spanning Tree* of a given *Network* with weighted *edges* (*ACMGM101*, *ACMGM102*)
	- determine the *Minimum Spanning Tree* by using *Kruskal's* or *Prim's algorithms* or by inspection
	- determine the definition of a *Tree* and a *Minimum Spanning Tree* for a given *Network*

We will implement both *algorithms* (*Kruskal's* and *Prim's*) today in *Edgy* and demonstrate how a computer can quickly find an *MST* on larger *Graphs*, where it may not be possible (or very difficult) to find an *MST* by inspection.
