# From Blocks to Text

## About 

In this session, you will learn about:

- The differences between *Blocks*, *Hybrid* and *Text* Languages
- Why you might chose a particular type of Language to teach *Coding* to your students
- Examples of different *Blocks*, *Hybrid* and *Text* Languages

After a presentation about moving students from *Blocks languages* to *Text languages*, you are welcome to explore the various *Links* on this session page for the rest of the session.

If you have been planning to learn a *Text* Language (for example: *Python*), then you may be interested in the [Reddit learnprogramming communityâ€™s FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/faq){:target="_blank"}, which offers some very helpful advice for beginning coders.

## Links

In this section, we have included links to websites for examples of the different types of *Coding* languages that are commonly used in K-12 education.

### Snap! and Edgy

The [Beauty and Joy of Computing Curriculum](http://bjc.berkeley.edu/website/curriculum.html){:target="_blank"} includes a module, titled [Besides Blocks](http://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/cur/programming/python/introduction_to_besides_blocks.html?topic=berkeley_bjc%2Fpython%2Fbesides-blocks-welcome.topic){:target="_blank"}, that introduces the *Text* Language *Python* and shows how *Snap!* blocks map to different commands in *Python*.

There is also a section in the [Programming with Edgy](https://www.alexandriarepository.org/syllabus/programming-with-edgy/64251/){:target="_blank"} tutorials that explain how you can create *Networks* in *Python* and how the commands in *Edgy* map to commands in *Python*.
