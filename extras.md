# Extras

On this page, we have included some supplementary materials that we have used in previous workshops.
These may be useful if you are looking for more activity ideas.

## Coding in Scratch

In this year's *CS4S Introduction* workshop we ran an activity for introducing *Coding* with the *Scratch* programming language.
*Scratch* is a great introductory language for teaching *Coding* and *Computational Thinking*, particularly at the upper levels of primary school and early levels of high school.

The materials from the *Coding in Scratch* session, as well as the other activities from the *CS4S Introduction* workshop can be [viewed here](https://cs4s.github.io/intro-2017/day1/coding/){:target="_blank"}.

## ScratchMaths

[ScratchMaths](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ioe/research/projects/scratchmaths){:target="_blank"} is a set of "open-access curriculum materials" for teaching *Coding* (with *Scratch* as the chosen language) and *Mathematics*.
The materials mainly involve *Mathematics* concepts from England's Key Stage 2 (Years 5 and 6) *Mathematics* curriculum.

## Bootstrap Maths

[Bootstrap](http://www.bootstrapworld.org/){:target="_blank"} is a curriculum, developed in the United States, for teaching *Mathematics* with *Coding*.
The materials are targeted towards high school students and cover a variety of *Mathematics* concepts, including: *Algebra*, *Geometry* and *Functions*.
